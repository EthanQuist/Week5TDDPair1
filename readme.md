cd build
cmake ..
make
Run program: ./app/shell-app
```



## Overview

This project contains our PID controller, which is primarily used through the compute function, around which the coverage coverage revolves.

## Notes:
-Do we need to update the UML diagram?  Nothing has really changed.
-Do we all have enough comments here?  We should all make sure we have the right doygen comments.
-Should we exclude main and lib?
-What else can we add to the running guide?
-Do we need a separate Doxygen tag for class, in addition to file?
